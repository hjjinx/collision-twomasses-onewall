# collision-twomasses-onewall
Physics simulation of two masses colliding with each other and a wall. All the collisions are elastic and the surface is frictionless. As the mass ratio of the blocks is increased, the number of collisions tend to approach pi. For mass ratio of 1, n(collisions) = 3; for mass ratio of 100, n(colls) = 31; for mass ratio of 10000, n(colls) = 314 and so on.

I created this simulation on my own after I saw this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs&t=159s
